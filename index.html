                <h3>Who Makes the Security Decisions</h3>
                <h4>Risk Cost Analysis, Decisions</h4>
                <p>As a burgeoning cybersecurity professional, it’s easy to slip into an almost arrogant attitude that I know best when it comes to matters of cybersecurity. Security and the CIA triad are at the forefront of my mind as the highest priority. While these things are important, ease of use and cost are paramount in many managers or executives minds. A security feature that will be perfectly secure always but costs more to run that the business will never make is not a good choice as while the business may be breach free, it will also rapidly become no longer a business. On the other hand, someone who purely looks at a spreadsheet for cost may not realize the risks associated with taking shortcuts and using cheaper methods in security. Somehow we need to strike a balance and a meeting point between cost and efficacy. For this a cybersecurity professional is essential to define risks and costs associated with them. With diligent risk assessment, costs and chances of dangers can be evaluated against the cost to mitigate or eliminate them. Some risk will always be present and is inherent to operating in the world today, but by collaboration between employees, we can chart the best course for the business.

                <h3>QR Codes: A New Spin</h3>
                <h4>Attack vectors, Security </h4>
                <p>
                    In a post covid world, a new vector for cyberattacks gained popularity, the qr code. They became ubiquitous in bars and restaurants as ways to order, access the menu or access websites in general. They come with all the risks of links but without the stigma or the dear. If you saw “go to bit.ly/xiwgy1ig” on the side of a building would you immediately navigate there? How about if there was a mural of a qr code, would you pull out your phone and see where it leads? QR codes can be used in new variations on old attacks. The example mentioned above is essentially a phishing attack, throw out a bait qr code with a link to a malicious web page and see what you catch. Attackers can also perform a low tech man in the middle attack with them. Bars often hand out the qr codes on cards or paper printouts in plastic. By replacing the qr code with one of the attackers choosing, potential customers can be redirected and their information stolen. This attack also comes with the advantage of attacking a population potentially distracted or under the influence of alcohol, making them less likely to notice differences. The last obvious way that these codes can be attacked is by attacking the site they link to. Many bars and restaurants sport websites that look like someone spent 30 minutes designing them back in 2010, with security vulnerabilities to match. Now user traffic is being directed through these including potentially payment info.
Everything I’ve said so far is great fear-mongering, but what can we do about these attacks, on both a business and personal level? The most obvious countermeasure is vigilance, scanning a qr code is the same as clicking a link and should be treated the same. Look for clues and hallmarks of a malicious or mirror site should always be in mind like misspellings or very similar domain names. We should also be cautious in general of scanning qr codes that we do not the origin of as they may point us in any which direction. Restaurants should consider harder to duplicate qr codes, such as those printed onto or into metal and wood vs paper to increase cost to replicate. Businesses need to modernize the security on their websites now that they are directing people there and update software to close old vulnerabilities. Above all, both sides need to stay vigilant.
