                <h3>Who Makes the Security Decisions</h3>
                <h4>Risk Cost Analysis, Decisions</h4>
                <p>As a burgeoning cybersecurity professional, itâ€™s easy to slip into an almost arrogant attitude that I know best when it comes to matters of cybersecurity. Security and the CIA triad are at the forefront of my mind as the highest priority. While these things are important, ease of use and cost are paramount in many managers or executives minds. A security feature that will be perfectly secure always but costs more to run that the business will never make is not a good choice as while the business may be breach free, it will also rapidly become no longer a business. On the other hand, someone who purely looks at a spreadsheet for cost may not realize the risks associated with taking shortcuts and using cheaper methods in security. Somehow we need to strike a balance and a meeting point between cost and efficacy. For this a cybersecurity professional is essential to define risks and costs associated with them. With diligent risk assessment, costs and chances of dangers can be evaluated against the cost to mitigate or eliminate them. Some risk will always be present and is inherent to operating in the world today, but by collaboration between employees, we can chart the best course for the business.
